# quantumc - A compiler for the quantum programming language.
´quantumc´ is the working title for a compiler for a language yet to be invented. It is written in [rust][1]. The goal is mainly to develop a compiler to learn more about a compilers inner workings and to learn more about programming language design.

# Features currently working
- Description of tokens using regular expressions and generation of a token stream from an input file.
- Description of a language grammar and parsing of that grammar.
- Basic error reporting.

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks goes to Torben Ægidius Mogensen, the author of the book [Basics of Compiler Design][2].
